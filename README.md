# Graphical User Interface for Drone Flight Controls Convex Optimization
Autonomous Controls Lab, University of Washington AA Department

User can visually model various two dimensional shapes such as ellipses, polygons, and planes and convert them into constraints for convex optimization. Application also models drone position, target waypoints, and current drone path. Layouts can be saved and loaded to and from files. Models can be mapped to ports for real time updating via TCP. Built on Qt framework for deployment on multiple platforms.
